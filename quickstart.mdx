<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="box" title="Adding a Cargo Owner">
    A cargo owner is the customer or company that owns the goods you’re shipping. For example, if you are shipping for Acme Factory ABC, then any
    shipments that you'd like to verify drivers or vet carriers for should be under the cargo owner Acme Factory ABC. To add a Cargo Owner, please

  <Accordion icon="steering-wheel" title="Adding a Driver">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clipboard-list" title="Adding a Shipment">
    A shipment is a load you plan to move from an origin to a destination. Add shipments to track status, timing, equipment, and who’s involved.
    What you need to fill out:
    - Load ID (required): A unique identifier for the shipment. If you do not fill this in, then we will fill this out for you with a 
    system generated Load ID.

</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Create a Verification Flow

<Accordion icon="diagram-project" title="Create a new flow">
  A flow is how you turn your verification process into something repeatable. To do this, follow these steps:

  - Start by opening [**Flows**](https://app.indemni.com/flows?page=1) in your dashboard and clicking [**New Flow**](https://app.indemni.com/flows/add-flow).  
  - Drag one of the following steps in sequential order:
    - ID Verification - this is how you ask the driver to complete verifications, and check for CDL compliance
    - Photo Step - this is how you request different photos from the driver at point of Pickup
    - Document Step - this is how you request a scan of the documents the driver has on hand during Pickup

  Once published, your flow runs the same way every time — consistent, auditable, and fast.
</Accordion>

### Step 4: Send a Verification Link

<Accordion icon="paper-plane" title="Create a new flow">
  Once you are ready to send a driver verification link, please navigate to [Vet Driver](https://app.indemni.com/vet-driver) in order 
  to issue a verification. A couple of quick notes

  - To issue a verification, you require a Driver, a Shipment and a Flow. If this is not created, each input has a button below for you to quick 
  add one of these objects 
  - We offer both single and team drivers 
  - Once you have selected a driver, flow and shipment, you can click the Vet Driver button. This will send a text message immediately to the driver 

  To review the status and results of the verification, please visit the [Verifications Page](https://app.indemni.com/verifications)
