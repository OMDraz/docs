## Welcome

Indemni offers an open API for integration into a variety of different tooling, including TMS systems, freight tech vendors 
and other software providers. For more information on partners that we integrate with, please contact our partnerships team 
and we can help you out.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
